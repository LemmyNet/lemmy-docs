# Administration info

Information for Lemmy instance admins, and those who want to run a server.

## Install

Lemmy has two primary installation methods, [manually with Docker](install_docker.md), and [automated with Ansible](install_ansible.md). We recommend using Ansible, because it simplifies the installation and also makes updating easier.

## Other installation methods

In some cases, it might be necessary to use [different installation methods](other_installation_methods.md). But we don't recommend this, and can't provide support for them.
