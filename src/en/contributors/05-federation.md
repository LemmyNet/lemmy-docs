## Federation

Lemmy uses the ActivityPub protocol for communication between servers. If you are unfamiliar with the protocol, you can start by reading the [resource links](06-resources.md#activitypub-resources). This document explains how to interact with it from other projects.

In Lemmy we use some specific terms to refer to ActivityPub items. They are essentially our specific implementations of well-known ActivityPub concepts:

- Community: `Group`
- User: `Person`
- Post: `Page`
- Comment: `Note`

Almost every action in Lemmy happens inside a group. The Federation Enhancement Proposal [Group Federation](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/feps/fep-1b12.md) gives a high-level overview how this works. The generic federation logic is implemented in the [activitypub-federation](https://github.com/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust) library. It can also be used by other Rust projects.

Sometimes you will see a notation like `Create/Note`. This refers to a `Create` activity with a `Note` as object.

Below are explanations and examples for all actors, objects and activities from Lemmy. These include many optional fields which you can safely ignore.

## Context

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/context.json}}
```

The context is identical for all activities and objects.

## Actors

### Community

An automated actor. Users can send posts or comments to it, which the community forwards to its followers in the form of `Announce`.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/objects/group.json}}
```

### Private Message

A direct message from one user to another. Can not include additional users. Threading is not implemented yet, so the `inReplyTo` field is missing.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/objects/chat_message.json}}
```

| Field Name     | Description                                                               |

## Collections

### Community Outbox

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/collections/group_outbox.json}}
```

The outbox only contains `Create/Post` activities for now.

### Community Followers

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/collections/group_followers.json}}
```

The followers collection is only used to expose the number of followers. Actor IDs are not included, to protect user privacy.

### Community Moderators

List of moderators who can perform actions like removing posts or banning users.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/collections/group_moderators.json}}
```

### Community Featured Posts

List of posts which are stickied in the community.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/collections/group_featured_posts.json}}
```

### User Outbox

Only contains `totalItems` count, but no actual `items` for privacy reasons.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/collections/person_outbox.json}}
```

## Activities

### User to Community

#### Follow

Each Community page has a "Follow" button. Clicking this triggers a `Follow` activity to be sent from the user to the Community inbox. The Community will automatically respond with an `Accept/Follow` activity to the user inbox. It will also add the user to its list of followers, and deliver any activities about Posts/Comments in the Community to the user.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/following/follow.json}}
```

#### Unfollow

After following a Community, the "Follow" button is replaced by "Unfollow". Clicking this sends an `Undo/Follow` activity to the Community inbox. The Community removes the User from its followers list and doesn't send any activities to it anymore.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/following/undo_follow.json}}
```

#### Create or Update Post

When a user creates a new post, it is sent to the respective community as `Create/Page`. Editing a previously created post sends an almost identical activity, except the `type` being `Update`.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/create_or_update/create_page.json}}
```

#### Create or Update Comment

A reply to a post, or to another comment as `Create/Note`. Can contain mentions of other users. Editing a previously created post sends an almost identical activity, except the `type` being `Update`.

The origin instance also scans the Comment for any User mentions, and sends the `Create/Note` to
those Users as well.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/create_or_update/create_note.json}}
```

#### Like Post or Comment

An upvote for a post or comment.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/voting/like_note.json}}
```

#### Dislike Post or Comment

A downvote for a post or comment.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/voting/dislike_page.json}}
```

#### Undo Like or Dislike Post or Comment

Revert a vote that was previously done by the same user.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/voting/undo_like_note.json}}
```

#### Delete Post or Comment

Mods can remove Posts and Comments from their Communities. Admins can remove any Posts or Comments on the entire site. Communities can also be removed by admins. The item is then hidden from all users.

Removals are sent to all followers of the Community, so that they also take effect there. The exception is if an admin removes an item from a Community which is hosted on a different instance. In this case, the removal only takes effect locally.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/delete_page.json}}
```

#### Undo Delete

Post or comment deletions can be reverted by the same user.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/undo_delete_page.json}}
```

#### Report Post, comment or private message

Reports content for rule violation, so that mods/admins can review it.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/report_page.json}}
```

#### Delete User

Sent when a user deletes his own account.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/delete_user.json}}
```

### Community to User

#### Accept Follow

Automatically sent by the community in response to a `Follow`. At the same time, the community adds this user to its followers list.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/following/accept.json}}
```

#### Announce

If the Community receives any Post or Comment related activity (Create, Update, Like, Dislike, Remove, Delete, Undo etc.), it will forward this to its followers. For this, an Announce is created with the Community as actor, and the received activity as object. This is sent to all followers, so they get updated in real time.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/announce_create_page.json}}
```

### Moderation

These actions can only be done by instance admins or community moderators. They are sent to the community and announced by it. See [](../users/04-moderation.md) for a general overview how moderation works in Lemmy. Communities can only be created on the same instance where a user is registered. After that, mods from other instances can be added with `Add/User` activity.

#### Remove Post or Comment

Removes a post or comment. The difference to delete is that remove activities have a summary field, which contains the reason for removal, as provided by the mod/admin.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/remove_note.json}}
```

#### Block User

Blocks a user so he can't participate anymore. The scope is determined by the `target` field: either a community, or a whole instance. The `removeData` field can optionally be set to indicate that all previous posts of the user should be deleted.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/block/block_user.json}}
```

#### Lock post

Posts can be locked so that no new comments can be created.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/lock_page.json}}
```

#### Undo mod actions

All previously listed mod actions can be reverted by wrapping the original activity in `Undo`. Note that Lemmy regenerates the inner activity with a new ID.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/undo_remove_note.json}}
```

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/block/undo_block_user.json}}
```

#### Add or remove featured post

Posts can be pinned so that they are always shown on top of the community. This is federated with the [Community featured posts](#community-featured-posts) collection.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/add_featured_post.json}}
```

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/remove_featured_post.json}}
```

#### Add or remove mod

Add a new mod to the community. Has to be sent by an existing community mod, or an admin of the community's instance.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/add_mod.json}}
```

An existing mod can be removed in the same way.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/community/remove_mod.json}}
```

### User to User

#### Follow a user

Users from other platforms can follow Lemmy users and receive all of their posts to the inbox. Note that users who are registered on Lemmy can only follow groups, not other users.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/pleroma/activities/follow.json}}
```

#### Create or Update Private message

User profiles have a "Send Message" button, which opens a dialog permitting to send a private message to this user. It is sent as a `Create/ChatMessage` to the user inbox. Private messages can only be directed at a single User. They can also be edited with `Update/ChatMessage`.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/create_or_update/create_private_message.json}}
```

#### Delete Private Message

Deletes a previous private message.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/delete_private_message.json}}
```

#### Undo Delete Private Message

Restores a previously deleted private message. The `object` is regenerated from scratch, as such the activity ID and other fields are different.

```json
{{#include ../../../include/crates/apub/assets/lemmy/activities/deletion/undo_delete_private_message.json}}
```
