# Troubleshooting

Different problems that can occur on a new instance, and how to solve them.

Many Lemmy features depend on a correct reverse proxy configuration. Make sure yours is equivalent to our [nginx config](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ansible/blob/main/templates/nginx.conf).

## General

### Logs

For frontend issues, check the [browser console](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337) for any error messages.

For server logs, run `docker-compose logs -f lemmy` in your installation folder. You can also do `docker-compose logs -f lemmy lemmy-ui pictrs` to get logs from different services.

If that doesn't give enough info, try changing the line `RUST_LOG=error` in `docker-compose.yml` to `RUST_LOG=info` or `RUST_LOG=verbose`, then do `docker-compose restart lemmy`.

### Creating admin user doesn't work

Make sure that websocket is working correctly, by checking the browser console for errors. In nginx, the following headers are important for this:

```
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
```

### Rate limit error when many users access the site

Check that the headers `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For` are sent to Lemmy by the reverse proxy. Otherwise, it will count all actions towards the rate limit of the reverse proxy's IP. In nginx it should look like this:

```
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
```

## Federation

### Other instances can't fetch local objects (community, post, etc)

Your reverse proxy (eg nginx) needs to forward requests with header `Accept: application/activity+json` to the backend. This is handled by the following lines:

```
set $proxpass "http://0.0.0.0:{{ lemmy_ui_port }}";
if ($http_accept = "application/activity+json") {
set $proxpass "http://0.0.0.0:{{ lemmy_port }}";
}
if ($http_accept = "application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"") {
set $proxpass "http://0.0.0.0:{{ lemmy_port }}";
}
proxy_pass $proxpass;
```

You can test that it works correctly by running the following commands, all of them should return valid JSON:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://your-instance.com/u/some-local-user
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://your-instance.com/c/some-local-community
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://your-instance.com/post/123 # the id of a local post
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://your-instance.com/comment/123 # the id of a local comment
```

### Fetching remote objects works, but posting/commenting in remote communities fails

Check that [federation is allowed on both instances](federation_getting_started.md).

Also ensure that the time is accurately set on your server. Activities are signed with a timestamp, and will be discarded if it is off by more than 10 seconds.

### Other instances don't receive actions reliably

Lemmy uses one queue per federated instance to send out activities. Search the logs for "Federation state" for summaries. Errors will also be logged.

For details, execute this SQL query:

```sql
select domain,currval('sent_activity_id_seq') as latest_id, last_successful_id,fail_count,last_retry from federation_queue_state
join instance on instance_id = instance.id order by last_successful_id asc;
```

You will see a table like the following:

| domain                     | latest_id | last_successful_id | fail_count | last_retry                    |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| toad.work                  | 6837196   | 6832351            | 14         | 2023-07-12 21:42:22.642379+00 |
| lemmy.deltaa.xyz           | 6837196   | 6837196            | 0          | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00        |
| battleangels.net           | 6837196   | 6837196            | 0          | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00        |
| social.fbxl.net            | 6837196   | 6837196            | 0          | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00        |
| mastodon.coloradocrest.net | 6837196   | 6837196            | 0          | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00        |

This will show you exactly which instances are up to date or not.
