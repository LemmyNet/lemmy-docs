# Goals

- Come up with a name / codename.
- Must have communities.
- Must have threaded comments.
- Must be federated: liking and following communities across instances.
- Be live-updating: have a right pane for new comments, and a main pain for the full threaded view.
  - Use websockets for post / gets to your own instance.

# Questions

- How does voting work? Should we go back to the old way of showing up and downvote counts? Or just a score?
- Decide on tech to be used
  - Backend: Actix, Diesel.
  - Frontend: inferno, typescript and bootstrap for now.
- Should it allow bots?
- Should the comments / votes be static, or feel like a chat, like [flowchat?](https://flow-chat.com).
  - Two pane model - Right pane is live comments, left pane is live tree view.
  - On mobile, allow you to switch between them. Default?
