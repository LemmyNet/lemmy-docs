# Configuration

The configuration is based on the file config.hjson, which is located by default at `config/config.hjson`. To change the default location, you can set the environment variable `LEMMY_CONFIG_LOCATION`.

An additional environment variable `LEMMY_DATABASE_URL` is available, which can be used with a PostgreSQL connection string like `postgres://lemmy:password@lemmy_db:5432/lemmy`, passing all connection details at once.

If the Docker container is not used, manually create the database specified above by running the following commands:

```bash
cd server
./db-init.sh
```

**Federation is not set up by default.** You can add this [this federation block](https://github.com/lemmynet/lemmy/blob/main/config/config.hjson#L64) to your `lemmy.hjson`, and ask other servers to add you to their allowlist.
